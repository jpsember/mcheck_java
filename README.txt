MCheck is a term project I developed in 2005 for a course at Simon Fraser University.  
It performs model checking on LTL and CTL formulas.
I converted the original project, which was written in C++, to Java.
See the original version's docs/mcheck.pdf for more information.

This version is an Eclipse Java project.
There are probably many source files in the 'base' package that can be removed, since
they are not used by the 'mcheck' package.
